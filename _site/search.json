Initially, her research explores how internet technologies enable ideological expression and digital activism. More recently, her focus has shifted to the urgent issue of structural violence, marginalization, and healthcare disparities faced by transgender communities in Ireland. Specifically, she investigates the role of alternative pathways to gender-affirming care, such as telemedicine and online gray markets, and their impact on transgender individuals’ sense of societal inclusion.\nThrough her advocacy work with Gender Rebels, a grassroots non-profit organisation supporting the transgender community, she is deeply committed to community-engaged scholarship, fostering strong partnerships with grassroots \\(LGBTQI+\\) organisations and working towards actionable and positive social change within the communities she studies."
